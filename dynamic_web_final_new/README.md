# The 1 Line

I used React + Vite, react-leaflet, three.js, and gsap to make a landing page with an interactive MTA map as well as a (very crappy) animation on the landing page.

# RUNNING THIS PROJECT

I used React + Vite, meaning 'npm start' won't do the trick. You'll need to run 'npm run dev' and open the localhost link that the terminal provides you to properly view this app.
